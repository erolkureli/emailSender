I have screenshots of my postman calls under data directory.Also, there is a json sample for send email call and an image from h2 db.
I can store uuid and byte array format of file to db. When sending the email, i can form the file back from db .
Then, i can send the email but there is a problem with viewing the embedded image file in email.
Unit tests are working.
User and password should be changed in application.yml file to send an email
